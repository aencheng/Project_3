## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- I had some difficulty figuring out how to change Button colors. android:background wouldn't change the color even though I used a different color. It was resolved.

- Android's BigDecimal Library sucks. The Java BigDecimal Library is 10x better.
